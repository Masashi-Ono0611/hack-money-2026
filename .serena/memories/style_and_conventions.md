# Style and Conventions

- **Language:**
  - Documentation/Specs: As per `spec.json` (likely Japanese based on README).
  - Commit Messages: English (Conventional Commits).
  - Chat Responses: Japanese (as per `AGENTS.md`).
- **Frontend Code:**
  - Use Biome for formatting.
  - Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Next.js App Router structure.
- **Contract Code:**
  - Follow Solidity best practices.
  - Comments explaining "why", not just "what".
- **Development Philosophy:**
  - Specs Driven Development (`.kiro/specs/`).
  - 3-phase approval: Requirements -> Design -> Tasks.
  - "Boy Scout Rule": Leave code better than found.
  - Error Handling: Fix root causes, don't suppress.
